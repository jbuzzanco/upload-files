# File upload Application.

### made with HTML, JavaScript.

This application is a front end that takes files.

If more time was available, I would:
- style the application more
- create the backend of this application, likely with Ruby on Rails
  in order to have create resource

I used "accept" in the html form in order to accept the filetypes of Word, PDF, + PNG.
Looked up how to do that with stackoverflow, a coding resource I look at almost everyday.

Thank you for your consideration.
Joel
